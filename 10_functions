functions can be defined to make your lengthy work short commands

print("Zaheer")
print("Zaheer")
print("Zaheer")
print("Zaheer")

#to make it a function we can define new function
#1st way
# see al world is defined by a single codanics function
def codanics():
    print("Zaheer")
    print("Zaheer")
    print("Zaheer")

codanics()
#
# # 2nd way, now you can change sigle thing and it will be applied to all repeated text
def codanics():
    text = "Zaheer ud Din"
    print(text)
    print(text)
codanics()

# third way simple way just use text text text and finally in codanics funtion put what you want to write
def codanics(text):
    print(text)
    print(text)
    print(text)
codanics("what is my Name is that Syed Zaheer ud Din")

###### function + if else

def codanics(age):
    if age == 5:
        print("Hammad can go to school")
    elif age <5:
        print("Hammad is a baby, take care at home")
    else:
        print("Hammad cannot go to school")
codanics(5)

# numberical function
#future age predictor age after 20 year

def future_age(age):
    new_age = age+20
    return new_age
    print(new_age)
predictive_future_age = future_age(2)
print(predictive_future_age)
